# Examples of my work

## geospatial
1. convert_coordinates -> Convert geographic coordinates from DM and DMS formats to DD format. It can handle several idiosyncracies in the source formats. 
2. distance_matrix ->  Create a table that contains a distance matrix with distances between all geometries in two geospatial layers. Unit for distances is the unit used by the layers' CRS. 
3. modis_multispectral_hdf -> Operations for importing and plotting MODIS multispectral surface reflectance LPDACC products. These products can be downloaded from https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/. 
4. nasa_oceandata_chla -> Operations for importing and plotting satellite L3 chlor_a data from https://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/opendap/. 

## probability_and_statistics
Code that explores aspects of probability and statistics
1. sum_of_dice -> Calculate the probability of rolling a certain sum with dice, partly based on [this article](https://www.mathsisfun.com/activity/dice-experiment-2.html).
2. DiscreteDistributionClasses -> Superclass for discrete probability distributions and subclasses for Bernoulli, Bionomial, Geometric, Poisson and Uniform distributions.
3. sampling_distribution_of_mean -> Generates a sampling distribution of the mean from a large random population for user-defined sample sizes. I wrote this to explore the central limit theorem.
4. randomisation_tests -> Statistical randomisation (permutation and combination) tests.
5. number_of_permutations_or_combinations -> Calculate the number of permutations and combinations from a given number of types to choose from and a given number of choices.

## pythonista
Apps built in Pythonista, "a full Python IDE for iOS". 
1. running -> a running app that monitors time, location, distance, speed and elevation during running. Under development

## misc
1. re_find_integer_or_decimal -> Regular expression that finds integers and decimal numbers in text, even when there are no spaces between them and other characters.
